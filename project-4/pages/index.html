            <h2>
              Why WireFrame?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Long story made very short, we should always wireframe because it ultimatly makes our desired final product come into fruition much easier. Essentially its blueprinting for web design. Just as blueprints make building structures easier, wireframing makes web design easier.

            <p>
                Wireframing is a quick and effective way to identify usability issues early on in your design process. Wireframes allow you to map out the functionality of the pages, catch problems early, and save time on revisions later. If you invest the time in thinking through the functionality of the pages through wireframing early on in your design process, you will be so happy you did. It is definitely time well spent and highly efficient. Mapping out the functionality early will reduce the amount of back and forth that often comes with the development phase. It is definitely easier to rewrite the function in a wireframe, compared to a web application.Finally, wireframes are a great way to prioritize content.

            <p>
                If your still not sure exactly what a wireframe is, its like a skeleton for the page. This skeleton is a two-dimensional depiction of a pageâ€™s interface that shows the spacing of elements on the page, how content is prioritized, what functionalities are available, and how users will interact with the site. They also play a vital role in connecting information architecture to the visual aspects of the design by showing pathways between the various pages. Wireframes are intentionally void of color, graphics and stylized fonts. Wireframes only use the shades gray, white, and black. They use generic font and avoid highly stylized graphics and images.
