#### Delivering
Essentially, I just want to make this a really simplistic web page discussing wireframes RWD and their relationship to each other. I plan to draw the viewers in by making the font red. Its sort of my style and aesthetic, but it also makes quite a statement. The primary content is about wireframes the second content is about wireframing. I plan to include some nice RWD websites at the bottom for interesting secondary content.

#### Fonts/ Color Palette
As per usual, Im going to use primarily the monospace font. I just really like it and it has an early internet nostalgia associated with it that makes me happy. I may make the paragraphs a thiner and more elegant font. For contrast. As for color palette well I'm going to go with my classic red, grey, black white. I like monochrome with the added statement of red. Its just kind of my thing. Until I'm being directed by someone else, ill stick to this color palette. I'm a creature of habit, and when I like something, it sticks.
