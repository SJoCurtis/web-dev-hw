I would like to do a snippet/entire essay for this latest project.

I would like to create a site for the essay *The Conscience of a Hacker*, by Loyd Blankenship a.k.a The Mentor. I may or may not include the entire essay, I may just make one snippet of it be the main attraction and have the rest of it available to read elsewhere on the site. Or just do the whole essay. I haven't quite decided yet. But for assignments sake, and say I only choose to do a portion. This is the portion that I would do.

> This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch, the
beauty of the baud.  We make use of a service already existing without paying
for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons, and
you call us criminals.  We explore... and you call us criminals.  We seek
after knowledge... and you call us criminals.  We exist without skin color,
without nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals.
You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us
and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals.
Yes, I am a criminal.  My crime is that of curiosity.  My crime is
that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like.
My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me
for.

>I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto.  You may stop this individual,
but you can't stop us all... after all, we're all alike.

For my sources and citations I will be using the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyd_Blankenship) page for him and also the ezine [Phrack](http://phrack.org/issues/14/3.html#article), where his manifesto was first published. Potentially other sites if I find some that are interesting to me.

The color palette I'm envisioning consists of blacks, grays, whites, and potentially some red accents.
