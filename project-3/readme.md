* I would like to do a snippet/entire essay for this latest project.
* I would like to create a site for the essay *The Conscience of a Hacker*, by the handle The Mentor. I may or may not include the entire essay, I may just make one snippet of it be the main attraction and have the rest of it available to read elsewhere on the site. Or just do the whole essay. I haven't quite decided yet. But for assignments sake, and say I only choose to do a portion. This is the portion that I would do.
>  This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch, the
   beauty of the baud.  We make use of a service already existing without paying
   for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons, and
   you call us criminals.  We explore... and you call us criminals.  We seek
   after knowledge... and you call us criminals.  We exist without skin color,
   without nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals.
   You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us
   and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals.
   Yes, I am a criminal.  My crime is that of curiosity.  My crime is
   that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like.
   My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me
   for.

>  I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto.  You may stop this individual,
   but you can't stop us all... after all, we're all alike.
