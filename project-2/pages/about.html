<p><span style="font-family:helvetica;">&nbsp;I am<em> a cofee addict</em><sup>TM</sup> hence why I chose to make this specific instuctable. When faced with this project I was like: what do I care enough about to make an <em><strong>entire freaking webpage</strong></em> on??? Well its either hacking/penetration testing/cybersecurity- which seemed too time consuming and difficult to explain, or my severe love and addiction to coffee. Coffee won, as it always does. It was simple, I love coffee, I want to share my love of coffee with the world, and I want people to know how to make some actually decent coffee. And so here I am, with a real bad webpage about real good coffee.&nbsp;</span>

<p><span style="font-family:helvetica;">My personal everyday coffee making process is quite different from this webpage, though I do at times indulge myself and make some nice chemex coffee. But usually I just make myself a cup of good ol&#39; fashioned pour over. Mostly out of necessity every morning....afternoon...okay and night. I have a problem. But when I have the time and feel inspired I will go through the long process of making delicious chemex coffee. I usually put on a hygge playlist. Cozy music. Take my sweet time. Let the sweet aroma fill my kitchen. Then I pour it into my favorite black mug. Settle into a nice couch and breath in the coffee fumes. Then I take a soft sip and smile with happiness. My coffee drinking process is normal for the most part, though theres somtimes a passion behind my drinking that is lacking in many others.&nbsp;</span>
