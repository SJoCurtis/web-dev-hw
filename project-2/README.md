# Project 2 README.md

### Week One
*I am ultimate procrastinator.* I can do the work, I just don't. For no other reason than that I'm crazy busy with work and other classes and living that I get lazy and put my online class on the back burner until its on fire and screaming. So you know. Ive gotta get my shit together.

1. A triumph is I did actually finally do the work and its no longer on fire and kind of looks okay. Im excited to continue working on this project to make it an actual thing. A think that does not look like neglected homework.

2. I am going to change my work ethic going forward.
I enjoy doing this, i just gotta make it a goal.

3. I really want this to look pretty darn decent and nice for a newb once I finish.

### Week Two
*I am the worst at following rules.* I understand the world of academia and coding within academia is based in lots of rules, and yet I still try to break them. My largest struggle this week was my wish to do thing I shouldn't, and not wanting to do things I was told to do. I'm just obstinate. Ultimately, I think I did a good job of following the rules, but Im not 100% sure.

1. A triumph was actually managing my time and not have to crunch to finish this. I gave myself enough time.

2. A struggle was photos, I have my photos saved in my photos folder. I just cant get them to work from there.

3. I think my webpage is ugly, but it has a little more potential than it did prior to this week.

### Week Three
*I hate everything* So this has actually been the worst week. Like in so many different ways. I was behind, late, and stressed with everything. Finals. Bad personal life things. Meh. Shh. Not a fan of this week and this project was just an added stressor. But hey it done and its not on fire so theres that I guess.
