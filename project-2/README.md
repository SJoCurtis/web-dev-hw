# Project 2 README.md
## Jo Curtis
*I am ultimate procrastinator.* I can do the work, I just don't. For no other reason than that I'm crazy busy with work and other classes and living that I get lazy and put my online class on the back burner until its on fire and screaming. So you know. Ive gotta get my shit together.

*A triumph is I did actually finally do the work and its no longer on fire and kind of looks okay. Im excited to continue working on this project to make it an actual thing. A think that does not llok like neglected homework.

  *I am going to change my work ethic going forward.
  *I enjoy doing this, i just gotta make it a goal.

*I really want this to look pretty darn decent and nice for a newb once I finish.
